A digital version of the party card game Lupus in Tabula. In this game there are different roles associated to characters and each of them can perform different actions during the game. The game is divided into 2 phases - day and night - and there are two parties who fight against one another: the village and the wolves. The game ends when one of the 2 parties manages to get the better of the other. 

The app is will allow players to play everywhere without additional requirements other than their devices. It will also make the role of the “Storyteller” in the game a lot easier, allowing him/her to visualise all the characters that are playing together with their abilities and conditions without having to remember them.
